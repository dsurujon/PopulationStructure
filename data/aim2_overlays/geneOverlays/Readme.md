## Supplementary Dataset 1

A phylogenetic tree for each adapted gene (from the TIGR4 PEN and CIP adaptation experiments) was generated from multiple sequence alignments of orthologous genes using PanX. The resistance phenotype of the strains that carry each ortholog was overlaid on the trees as a heatmap. In most cases, susceptible and resistance strains were not separated by the tree.     
    
The [pbp2x gene](https://github.com/dsurujon/PopulationStructure/blob/main/data/aim2_overlays/geneOverlays/PEN/GC00000569.pdf), which acquired a mutation during adaptation under Penicillin, does seem to have divergent sequences when the ortholog is in a resistant strain, making it the one exception to the above. 
    
The 2 `.csv` files in this directory list the adapted genes identified in either experiment (CIP or PEN adaptation), and their cluster IDs.     
The `.pdf` files in the `CIP` and `PEN` directories show the trees overlaid with susceptibility phenotype to the corresponding antibiotics.
